Individual tree detection and ground based statistical approach for forestry application using LiDAR derived Raster
==============

This study project is focus on the Lidar acquired raster datasets and spatio-temporal analysis.LiDAR individual tree detection (ITD) is a interactive method for measuring forest areas at a scale that is meaningful ecologically and useful for forest managers.The main objective of this Project,to find individual tree detection based on DSM,DTM and utilize raster canopy height models from the lidar is handling of tree crowns of different sizes.However,Delination of ITD has high accuracy for trees that are visible from above but does not reliably detect trees in lower canopy strata.ITD is more accurate for upper-canopy trees is useful, there is alack of practical understanding of how ITD results might vary with changes in structure.In this scenerio, i have tried to apply LiDAR derived raster to produced high resolution low altitude trees, which useful to identify the abandoned and lower canopy.Furthermore to compare with the ITD derived from the CHM ,based on temporal data analysis.It useful for identify the trees properties monitoring, visualisation and analysis of Forest Geographical information Management.we also discuss the ground truth data validation compare with Lidar derived information
